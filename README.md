# Advanced_Computer_architecture
Code for ECE 6100 advanced computer architecture

The labs use trace driven simulations/committed instructions and thus the labs are meant to count number of cycles taken to show efficiency of different implementations. No data is being passed aroudn in the traces

Lab_1: Introduction, basic counting number of instructions, instructions type etc

Lab_2: Implement an in-order superscalar pipeline with perfect and G-share branch predicition
